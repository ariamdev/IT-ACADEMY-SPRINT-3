**1. Patterns 1**
=

Applying the Singelton, Abstract Factory and Command patterns.

>**How are the activities organized?**
>
>Each theme contains 3 levels of difficulty. The higher the level, the greater the difficulty. Likewise, the same level may contain more than one exercise.


🌟 Level 1
-

#### 📍 [Exercise 1 - Singelton]()

Create a class that replicates the operation of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by the Main class, which will allow you to enter console options.

- The 'Undo' class must save the latest orders entered. It must allow you to add or remove orders, as well as to list the latest orders entered (similar to the 'history' command on Linux).
- The 'Undo' class must necessarily implement a Singleton pattern.

---

⭐🌟 Level 2
-

#### 📍 [Exercise 2 - Abstract Factory]()

Create a small manager of international address and telephone numbers.

- The app should allow you to add to the international agenda, addresses and phone numbers. 
- Taking into account the different formats of the different countries, it builds the agenda, addresses and telephones by implementing an Abstract Factory pattern.

---

⭐⭐🌟 Level 3
-

#### 📍 [Exercise 3 - Command]()

Design a car parking with 4 vehicles: a car, a bicycle, a plane and a boat.

- Show how the Command pattern works that implements booting, accelerating, and slowing methods for each type of vehicle.
